I do believe that the paper has improved a lot but still not ready. In
my opinion they only partially followed reviewers' recommendations. 
In Section VB the misbalance between injured/uninjured	(4//13) is
strange. If this system is willing to support injured individuals a
more balanced sample is required. Still, if authors balance it to
13//13 then the sample still short as to support your claims. In the
discussion this fact ought to be addressed in full detail.
In Section VI, you give data but you did not discuss the size and
misbalance of the sample. In my humble opinion 17 individuals are not
enough to support your claims. Still, I see the value of the
experiments as first step towards the a system that supports Shared
Autonomy.

I recommend the authors to have a look on:

Dear Editors,

We thank you and the reviewers for your time and feedback regarding our
submission, and are delighted that the paper has been accepted for
publication in RA-L.

We appreciate the continued comments from Reviewer 5. To address them,
we have incorporated some of the suggested related literature, have
further analyzed our data to strengthen and clarify our claims (first
paragraph of VI.A), and have emphasized within the conclusion our
intentions of running a later (non-pilot) study on a larger subject
population. We do however respectfully disagree with Reviewer 5 on the
matter of an inadequate number of subjects, as we do have enough data to
demonstrate statistical significance. (It furthermore was unclear to us
how many subjects Reviewer 5 believes would be appropriate, and on what
data this belief was based.)

Thank you very much!

Sincerely,
Deepak E. Gopinath, Siddarth Jain and Brenna D. Argall
